# How to set the webhook response

There are cases where you need to modify the response of a webhook. Usually this is for some kind of validation that the webhook is setup correctly and can handle the response.

OttoFMS will use the value in the Exit Script step to set the response to the webhook. The response will be in JSON format.
{}
The following is an example of a webhook response:

```json
{
  "useScriptResult": true,
  "status": 200,
  "statusMessage": "OK",
  "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  "body": "{}"
}
```

The `useScriptResult` property should be set to true. This will signal OttoFMS to use the properties in that JSON to set the response to the webhook.

In the response above the status is set to 200, the status message is set to "OK", the content type is set to "application/json" and the body is set to an empty JSON object.
