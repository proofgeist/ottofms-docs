# Deployment Patterns

There are several types of deployments or `deployment Patterns` that are commonly used. This section will cover some of the most common. Please note that there aren't hard and fast rules here. You may need to modify these patterns to fit your needs. But this should give you a good starting point to understanding what OttoDeploy can do for you.
