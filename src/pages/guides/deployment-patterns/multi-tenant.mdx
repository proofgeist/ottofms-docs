# Multi-tenant Pattern

If you are a vertical market solution provider then this pattern will appeal to you.

<Callout type="info">
  **Single server variation** This document covers upgrading several customer
  applications that are all running on a single server. If you have many servers
  to upgrade then you will need to repeat this process for each server for now.
  We have multi-server target support on our near-term roadmap for OttoDeploy

## Problem

You want upgrade several customer applications that are all running on a single server with the same "new version" of your application.

## Solution

### Sub-deployments

You can use sub-deployments to deploy the same version from your dev server or from a "release build" to each of the application instances running on the server. Each sub deployment can be setup to use the specific file names and file options for each customer.

#### Atomic sub-deployments

Since each sub-deployment is atomic, if one of the sub-deployments fails then the remaining sub-deployments will not be effected, unless you use the abort remaining option.

### Advanced options

You will need to turn on the "Advanced options" in the deployment settings to use the Sub-deployments and Abort Remaining options.
