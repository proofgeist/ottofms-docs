# Custom Deployments with OttoFMS and FileMaker

This guide summarizes the key points from our video tutorial on using the OttoFMS Developer API with FileMaker scripting for custom deployments.The video demonstrates how to:

1. Access and use the OttoFMS Developer API
2. Copy deployment JSON directly from OttoDeploy
3. Create FileMaker scripts that trigger deployments via API calls
4. Set up custom conditions for automated deployments

By watching the video, you'll learn techniques to deploy FileMaker solutions based on specific criteria like dates, user actions, or any scriptable condition. This approach combines OttoDeploy's ease of use with greater deployment flexibility.

## Coming from Otto3 and Migrator.fmp12?

If you are used to using Migrator.fmp12 to write custom FileMaker scripts to deploy your FileMaker solutions, this tutorial will show you how to transition to using the OttoFMS Developer API to achieve the same result.
