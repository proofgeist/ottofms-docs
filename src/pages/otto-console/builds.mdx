# Builds

The OttoFMS Builds console is a historical record of all builds that have run on the server. For more information on builds and their uses, check out the [concepts doc](/concepts/builds).

Builds are only useable when they remain in the outbox (or have been published to another location). If a build is deleted from the outbox, it will no longer be available for use in a deployment.

## Builds List

The Builds List shows a list of all builds that have run on the server. You can rerun and delete builds from the list.
