# Connected clients

This page shows a list of all the connected clients.

You can message or disconnect individual clients by clicking the three dots on the right of each client. If you would like to manage multiple clients at once, you can select multiple clients and use the buttons at the top of the list. With no clients selected the top buttons will work on all clients.
