# FileMaker Databases

On this tab you can find a list of all the FileMaker database files that are on the server. You can upload new database files to the FileMaker Server from here as well.

## Uploading Files

Click the **Upload** button to upload one or more database files to the server.

OttoFMS uses a resumable uploader to allow you to upload very large files. If the upload is interrupted, simply select the same file again and the upload will resume from where it left off.

After the files are uploaded, OttoFMS will automatically open the files for you. If you upload an encrypted file, you must open the file manually and enter the encryption password.

## File Actions

Click the three dots on the right to see the options for the database. You can use the menu to **open**, **close**, **pause**, **resume**, **download**, **encrypt**, or **delete** the database file.

OttoFMS can download a hosted FileMaker file without needing to close it first. When you download a file from this interface, OttoFMS makes an ad-hoc backup of the file and then downloads the backup. When you download a clone, no data is included which can often result in a much smaller file size.

Files can be managed en masse by selecting multiple files and using the buttons at the top of the list.

### Renaming Files

OttoFMS allows you to rename files by either selecting multiple and using the action menu at the top of the file list to rename them, or by clicking the three dots on the right of the file and selecting "Rename". This will open a dialog where you can enter a new name for the file(s).

If you are renaming multiple files, you can use the FMDeveloperTool to do the rename. The FMDeveloperTool will properly handle external file references between files in your fileset.

Renaming files will close all selected files, change the filenames, and reopen the files. This allows you to quickly rename multiple files without having to download and rename them locally.

When renaming files, OttoFMS will also rename External Container Data folders for the file(s).

When using the FMDeveloperTool to rename files, new copies of the files will be created. If you are not using the FMDeveloperTool, you can choose to create copies of the files with the new name, or rename the files in place.

<Callout type="info">
  Prior to OttoFMS version 4.8.0, you could only rename one file at a time and
  could not use the FMDeveloperTool to do the rename.

### Save As XML

<Callout type="info">
  This feature requires FileMaker Server 20.3 or later
</Callout>

You can use the **Save As XML** option to generate an XML representation of the database. Full Access credentials are required to generate the XML, then the XML file is downloaded to your computer. You can optionally save the XML file to the server Documents folder as well. The XML contains a timestamp so you can compare two versions of the same database to see what has changed using a tool like [FMComparison](https://www.fmcomparison.com/).

### File Encryption

Servers running FileMaker Server 20.3 or higher can encrypt and decrypt files right from the OttoFMS console.

To encrypt a file, click the **Encrypt** option in the file menu. You will be prompted to enter a password for the encryption as well as an account and sharedId for the file.

To decrypt a file, click the **Decrypt** option in the file menu. You will be prompted to enter the password you used to encrypt the file and an account to use for running the decryption.
