<Callout type="warning">
  **Be careful** Stopping, or restarting services can lead to processes not
  completing. These should only be used when you believe the process or service
  in question is already hung or otherwise non-responsive.
</Callout>

From this page you control most of the separate sub-services of the server. You can start, stop, restart each service.
