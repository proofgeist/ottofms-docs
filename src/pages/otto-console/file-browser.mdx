# File Browser

OttoFMS includes a File Browser that gives you access to all of the important directories on your FileMaker Server. The File Browser allows you to upload, download, rename, and delete files. You can also create new folders and restore backups of your files from the File Browser.

The "Live Databases" folder contains links to all of your servers Database and Container Data folders. You are not able to edit or download .fmp12 files in these folders to protect your files. If you need to manage your Live Databases, check out the [Databases](/otto-console/filemaker-server/databases) page. In the Live Databases folder you can manage any files in the Removed_by_FMS folders. You can also manage external container data and other files in these folders that are not live databases.

The "Offsite Storage" folder (introduced in OttoFMS 4.9.0) contains links to the offsite storage locations you set up in the [Offsite Backup Settings](/otto-console/settings#offsite-backups) page. You can download, delete, and restore files from these locations within the File Browser. At this time, you cannot restore files from offsite locations with their container data, so any restoring of container data has to be a more manual process.

For certain files and folders in the File Browser, you can get a pre-signed URL to download the file/folder from the right click menu or the three dot menu on the right side of the file/folder. This is useful if you need to send a file to a client or partner without having to manually upload the file to a shared location.

The File Browser is also available from the Server Dashboard in the [Ottomatic Cloud Console](https://console.ottomatic.cloud).
