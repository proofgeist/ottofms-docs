# API Keys

On this page you can manage the API Keys that have been configured for the databases on your server. The API Keys allow you to use the FileMaker Data API to access the data in your databases, without having to use usernames and passwords. Learn more about how to create and use API Keys in the [API Keys Guide](/guides/api-keys).

## List view

The list view shows all the API Keys that have been configured for the databases on your server. You can add a new Key by clicking the "Create API Key" button in the top right corner. You can also edit or delete existing keys by clicking the "Edit" or trash can buttons on the right edge of the list.

## Admin API Keys

Admin API Keys are what OttoFMS uses to manage your FileMaker Server login for any processes that require it. You can create a new Admin API Key by clicking the "Create Admin API Key" button in the top right corner of the list view.

We use Admin API Keys to proxy to the Admin API of your FileMaker Server. This allows us to use the API without constantly having to create new admin sessions with FileMaker. You can create Admin API tokens for any process that needs to query the FileMaker or OttoFMS APIs. To use the FileMaker API with an OttoFMS Admin API key, you will need to prefix the api path with `/otto`. For more information on the proxy, see the [API Proxy](/api-proxy) page.

Admin API Keys are used to query your server from OttoDeploy.
