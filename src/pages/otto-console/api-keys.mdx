# API Keys

On this page you can manage the API Keys that have been configured for the databases on your server. The API Keys allow you to use the FileMaker Data API to access the data in your databases, without having to use usernames and passwords. Learn more about how to create and use API Keys in the [API Keys Guide](/guides/api-keys).

## List view

The list view shows all the API Keys that have been configured for the databases on your server. You can add a new Key by clicking the "Create API Key" button in the top right corner. You can also edit or delete existing keys by clicking the "Edit" or trash can buttons on the right edge of the list.
