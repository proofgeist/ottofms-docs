# Offsite Backup Providers Configuration

s3 compatible providers are supported. Each provider may provide their S3 compatible settings in a slightly different way. But to setup with OttoFMS you will need the following information.

- Endpoint
- Access Key Id
- Access Key Secret
- Region (optional) - But add if you have it
- Bucket

Each provider may also require a specific configuration to be setup in its backend setup. Please refer to the provider's documentation for more information.

Below we have provided some examples and notes for some of the providers

## Ottomatic Cloud storage

Ottomatic Cloud storage is a S3 compatible storage is available to purchase through the Ottomatic Cloud Console. You can configure servers with a single click from the console. If you don't already use a provider, we recommend using Ottomatic Cloud storage, as it is the simplest to setup.

- endpoint: (region).vultrobjects.com
- Access Key Id: (access-key)
- Access Key Secret: (secret-key)
- Region: (region)
- Bucket: (bucket-name)

## Amazon S3

- endpoint: s3.(region).amazonaws.com or (bucket-name).s3.(region).amazonaws.com
- Access Key Id: (access-key)
- Access Key Secret: (secret-key)
- Region: (region)
- Bucket: (bucket-name)

<Callout type="info">
OttoFMS uses the following AWS permissions to do file transfers to AWS S3 storage:
* `ListBucket`
* `DeleteObject`
* `GetObject`
* `PutObject`
* `PutObjectACL`
* `CreateBucket`

The `ListAllMyBuckets` permission is also recommended, as that allows OttoFMS to give you a list of buckets to choose from when creating offsite schedules. Without this you will need to enter a full path when adding an offsite location and manually enter the bucket when creating a schedule.
