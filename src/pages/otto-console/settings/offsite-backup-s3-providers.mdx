# Offsite Backup Providers Configuration

s3 compatible providers are supported. Each provider may provide their S3 compatible settings in a slightly different way. But to setup with OttoFMS you will need the following information.

- Endpoint
- Access Key Id
- Access Key Secret
- Region (optional) - But add if you have it
- Bucket

Each provider may also require a specific configuration to be setup in its backend setup. Please refer to the provider's documentation for more information.
