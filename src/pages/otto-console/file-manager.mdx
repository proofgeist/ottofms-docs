# File Manager

OttoFms includes a File Manager that gives you access to all of the important directories on your FileMaker Server. Depending on which folders you have access to, you can upload, download, and delete files. You can also create new folders and rename existing ones. In the future you will be able to restore backups from the File Manager as well.
