# OttoFMS Developer API

OttoFMS has a [Developer API](/apidoc) that works the same way as the FileMaker Server Admin API. In fact, you can think of it as an extension to the Admin API. It uses the same authentication by default and is even documented in the same manner. OttoDeploy uses this API to get it's work done.

## Made for developers

You can use this API to build your own tools to manage your FileMaker Server. The documentation is hosted alongside the OttoFMS dashbaord so you can always check the docs according to your installed version of OttoFMS. You can also view the most current docs [here](/apidoc).

## You may not need it.

We hope that OttoFMS and it's companion apps like OttoDeploy will cover 90% of all the uses cases out there, so you don't have to use the API directly. But if you do, it's there for you.

## Other APIs

You may also be intereted in the proxies for both the FileMAker Data and Admin API keys
