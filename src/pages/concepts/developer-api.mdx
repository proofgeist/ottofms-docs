# OttoFMS Developer API

OttoFMS has a [Developer API](/apidoc) that works the same way as the FileMaker Server provided Admin API. In fact, you can think of it as an extension to the Admin API. It uses the same authentication by default and is even documented in the same manner.

OttoDeploy uses this API to get it's work done.

## Made for developers

You can us this API, to build your own tools to manage your FileMaker Server. It is fully documented,

## You may not need it.

We hope that OttoFMS and it's companion apps like OttoDeploy will cover 80 to 90 percent of all the uses cases out there, so you don't have to use the API directly. But if you do, it's there for you.
