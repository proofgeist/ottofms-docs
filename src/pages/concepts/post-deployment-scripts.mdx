# Post Deployment Scripts

When you deploy a file to a server you may need to run a script to setup file for use or to complete an upgrade process that can't be done as part of data migration.

## How to use

OttoDeploy includes an option to run a Post Deployment script after a file has been deployed to a server. This script can be used to do any setup that is required after the file has been deployed.

The OttoFms Developer API will let you pass an optional script to run after the file has been deployed. This script will be run after the file has been deployed and any data migration has completed.

## Example use cases

### Data cleanup

Imagine that as part of an upgrade you want to split a field into two fields. Lets say you have a field called `Name` that contains a full name and you want to split it into `FirstName` and `LastName`. You can't do this as part of the data migration because `FirstName` and `LastName` don't have values in the old version. They will be empty after a data migration.

So you can run a post deployment script that splits the value from the `Name` field into `FirstName` and `LastName` after the data migration has completed.

### Setup a file for first use

If you have an application that you sell to many customers, you may want to run a script after it get's installed on to a server for the first time. This script could setup the database, create a user account, or do any other setup that is required before the application can be used.

### Resetting static data

You may have some tables that should only contain certain values. You can use a Post Deployment script to reset these tables to their default values.

### Clearing log data

You may want to clear out log data from a table after a certain period of time. Since a data migration will copy all the data in to your new file You can use a Post Deployment script to do this.
