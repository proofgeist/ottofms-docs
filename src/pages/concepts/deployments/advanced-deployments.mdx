## Advanced Deployments

Advanced deployments allow for more complex deployment patterns and situations.

Most users will not need to make use of the advanced deployment features. But if you are a vertical market solution provider, or you want to incorporate a staging server into your setup, or for any other more advanced workflows, you will want to use the Advanced interface.

See the [OttoDeploy documentation](/ottodeploy) for how to turn on Advanced options.

### Sub-deployments

Sub-deployments are a way to break up a deployment into smaller sets of files. There are two main use cases for sub-deployments: using multiple sources and upgrading multiple versions of the same file.

Each sub-deployment can be configured to pull from a different source server. For example, they can be used to do a install from a production server onto a staging server and then migrate the new version of the schema from the development server. See our [Refresh Staging](/guides/deployment-patterns/refresh-staging) for more information.

Sub-deployments can be used if you need to upgrade many copies of a single solution running on a server. For example, if you have 10 copies of a solution running on a server, you can create a sub-deployment for each copy.

There are a few benefits to using a sub-deployments over a single deployment:

- If one sub-deployment fails the other sub-deployments will not be reverted.
  - This behavior can be slightly adjusted using the [Abort Remaining on Failure](/ottodeploy-features/deployments/advanced-options#abort-remaining-on-failure) option, which will stop all remaining sub-deployments if one sub-deployment in the set fails.
- Sub-deployments can use multiple different sources for the files, allowing you to run a set of 5 sub-deployments from 5 different sources, whereas in Otto v3 you needed to run 5 separate migrations.

#### What sub-deployments can't do

Sub-deployments can't be scheduled separately. If you need to schedule a sub-deployment separately, you will need to create a separate deployment for it.

Sub-deployments can't target different destination servers. A sub-deployment can use a different source for the files, but they will all use the same destination server. If you need to deploy to different destination servers, you will need to create a separate deployment for each destination server.
