# Schedules

OttoFMS comes with the ability to schedule a [Deployment](/concepts/deployments) to run at a later date and time. This is useful if you would like to setup a deployment to run after hours when no one is using the system.

## FileMaker Server Script Schedules

Rather then creating another way to schedule actions on a FileMaker Server, OttoFMS uses FileMaker Server's Script and Verify Schedules feature to trigger the deployment.

## How does it work?

When you send a deployment to OttoFMS it checks a scheduled flag and timestamp. If it finds a valid flag and timestamp, it will create a [script schedule](https://help.claris.com/en/server-help/content/schedule-run-fm-script.html). on the FileMaker Server that will trigger the deployment at the specified time.

We generate a name for the schedule, but this name can be changed. If you need to change information about a schedule after it has been setup, you can edit the scheduled time and name from the FileMaker Server Admin Console.

<Callout type="warning">
  Editing the selected system script or the script parameters will break the
  schedule, ensure that they are not changed if you edit the name or scheduled
  time.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Running two schedules at the same time will cause one of the two to fail.
  Ensure that your schedules have enough buffer time between them for the entire
  deployment to run before another deployment begins.
