# Publishing Builds

While builds are useful on their source server, their purpose is truly to be a package of files which can be moved around. Deployments normally manage the movement of builds themself, but OttoFMS version 4.5.0 introduces the ability to more granularly control the distribution of builds to other servers or to public URLs.

## Publishing a build

Publishing builds allows you to move the build out of your source server's build outbox. At the moment you can publish a build to the source server's HTTP folder or to a destination server's build inbox.

All builds can be published at the end of the build, simply define your publish destinations in the [build settings in OttoDeploy](/ottodeploy-features/builds#publish-build). Builds can also be published after they are run using the [Developer API](/concepts/developer-api).

### Publishing to the source server's HTTP folder

Publishing a build to the source server's HTTP folder allows you to use the build as a public URL for deployments without having to manage a separate web server to host the build. Check out the [Public Builds](/concepts/builds/public-builds) page for more details on what public builds are and why you might want them.

### Publishing to a destination server's build inbox

Publishing a build to a destination server's build inbox allows you to skip the fetching process when running a deployment using that build. This is useful if you want to reduce deployment times. For an example of how to use this feature, see the [Low Downtime Deployments](/guides/deployment-patterns/low-downtime) guide.
