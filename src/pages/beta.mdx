## Installing the Beta

<Steps>

### Get a license key

A free license key is required to install OttoFMS. Make sure you obtain your license key from your account at [https://ottofms.com](https://ottofms.com) before installing.

Your license key is the same for the beta and release versions of OttoFMS. You will not have to change your license when you upgrade to the stable release, and likewise if you have already licensed OttoFMS the beta versions will be licensed as well.

### Uninstall old version of OttoFMS

If you were running a previous version of OttoFMS, you will need to [uninstall](/managing-ottofms#uninstalling) it before installing the beta. Your license key and other data will be saved.
