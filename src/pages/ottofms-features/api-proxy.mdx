# API Proxy

OttoFMS exposes proxy access for the FileMaker Data API, FileMaker OData API, and FileMaker Admin API. The proxy allows you to access these FileMaker APIs using long-lived API keys instead of your username and password.

## Data API Proxy

<Callout type="info">
  Think of a Data API key as a replacement for a set of FileMaker credentials to
  a specific FileMaker file. It provides access to the FileMaker Data API for
  that file.
</Callout>

First, create a Data API key ([guide](/guides/api-keys)). Data API keys are linked to a single database file and replace the FileMaker credentials for that file. The credentials you enter must have the `fmrest` privilege set for that file.

Add the following header to your HTTP request:

```
Authorization: Bearer dk_12395874
```

Or add the following query parameter to your URL:

```
?apiKey=dk_12395874
```

Prefix the base URL with `/otto`. For example:

```
https://filemaker.yourserver.com/otto/fmi/data/vLatest
```

## OData API Proxy (OttoFMS 4.11.0)

The OData Proxy also uses Data API Keys, similar to the Data API Proxy. When creating a Data API Key to use for the OData Proxy, you'll need to check the "OData" checkbox. The credentials you enter must have the `fmodata` privilege set for that file.

Add the following header to your HTTP request:

```
Authorization: Bearer dk_12395874
```

Or add the following query parameter to your URL:

```
?apiKey=dk_12395874
```

Prefix the base URL with `/otto`. For example:

```
https://filemaker.yourserver.com/otto/fmi/odata/v4
```

## Admin API Proxy

<Callout type="info">
  Think of an Admin API key as a replacement for your FileMaker Server Admin
  Console credentials. It provides access to both the FileMaker Admin API and
  the Otto Developer API.
</Callout>

First, create an Admin API Key ([guide](/guides/api-keys)).

Add the following header to your HTTP request:

```
Authorization: Bearer ak_123987
```

Prefix the base URL with `/otto`. For example:

```
https://filemaker.yourserver.com/otto/fmi/admin/v2
```

You can also use an Admin API key to authenticate against the Otto Developer API.
