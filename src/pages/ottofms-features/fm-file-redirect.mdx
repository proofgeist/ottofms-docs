# FileMaker File Redirect

OttoFMS exposes a url to redirect a user to a FileMaker file and to run a script upon opening that file. This can be useful for OAuth redirects within FileMaker, kicking off a specific action from an external link, or for anything where you may need to pass dynamic arguments to FileMaker from the web.

The FileMaker File Redirect feature is available in OttoFMS 4.7.0 and later.

## Usage

The Redirect URL has the following format:

```
https://<server>/otto/redirect/fm/[filename]/[script-name]?arg1=[value1]&arg2=[value2]&...
```

<Callout type="info">
  To run a script upon opening a file from the redirect url, the user must have
  the `fmurlscript` extended privilege.
</Callout>

### Arguments

- `filename`: The name of the FileMaker file to open.
- `script`: The name of the script to run.
- `arg`: The arguments to pass to the script. These values are passed into the script as variables with the name of the parameter in the query (eg. `?token=abc123` in the url becomes `$token="abc123"` in the script).

<Callout type="info">
  The `filename` and `script` parameters are required.
</Callout>
