## Advanced Options

OttoDeploy exposes a set of Advanced options for deployments which can be used for more advanced use cases. When you turn on the Advanced options you will see a set of new options, including:

- Add sub-deployment
- Use a different source for each deployment
- Optionally abort remaining sub-deployments if one fails

If you would like to turn the advanced options on for new deployments by default, you can change that in the [OttoDeploy settings](/ottodeploy-features/settings).

## Turn on Advanced Deployments

If you need the Advanced Options you can turn them on and off by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of the deployment view.

### Selecting a Build

Using the advanced options allows you to specify a source build to deploy to your destination. The builds will be fetched from your source server to select, and you can choose to deploy a specific build or to build the latest version of your source file using a "Just in Time" build. By default, we will run a Just in time build if you do not select a specific build. Just in Time builds are also the default for deployments not using advanced options.

For more information on builds, see our [Builds](/concepts/builds) documentation.

### Abort Remaining on Failure

The Abort Remaining on Failure option allows you to prevent running subsequent sub-deployments if one fails. This may be useful if you are running a series of sub-deployments that depend on the preceding sub-deployment to succeed. Setting the Abort Remaining on Failure option will prevent the subsequent sub-deployments from running if a preceding sub-deployment fails. The failing sub-deployment will still be fully reverted and the deployment will be marked as failed.

For example, if you have a deployment with three sub-deployments and the second sub-deployment fails, the third sub-deployment will not run. The first sub-deployment will not be reverted, as it was fully successful.

If you do not want to abort the remaining sub-deployments if one fails, turn off the Abort Remaining on Failure option. This would be the case if you were deploying a single file to three different files on the destination server and they did not depend on one another. This is the default setting.

### Sub-Deployments

Sub-Deployments are described in detail in the [Sub-Deployments](/concepts/deployments#sub-deployments) section of the documentation.

Each sub-deployment gets the option to use an alternate source (including a different build!) and to run seperate post-deployment scripts or close specific files while running. Sub-deployments can be easily re-ordered using the arrow buttons in the top-right corner of the sub-deployment. There is also the option to duplication sub-deployments and delete specific sub-deployments in the top-right corner of each sub-deployment.

Each sub-deployment requires a name and source files. The name is used to identify that sub-deployment in the OttoFMS console.

### Use Alternate Source

Each sub-deployment can use an alternate source to fetchh its source files. The source can be a different build on the same source server, a different server, or even an external url. If you do not turn on the "Use Anternate Source" toggle, the sub-deployment will use the default surce you selected at the top of your deployment.
