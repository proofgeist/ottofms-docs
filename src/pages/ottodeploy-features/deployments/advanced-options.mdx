## Advanced Options

When you turn on the Advanced options you will see a set of new options, including:

- Add sub-deployment
- Use a different source for each deployment
- Optionally abort remaining sub-deployments if one fails

If you would like to turn the advanced options on for new deployments by default, you can change that in the settings.
