# Post Deployment Scripts in OttoDeploy

[Post Deployment Scripts](/concepts/deployments/post-deployment-scripts) are scripts that are run after a file has been deployed to a server. See the [section](/concepts/deployments/post-deployment-scripts) in Concepts for more information on what Post Deployment Scripts are, and why you might want to use them.

## How to use

[OttoDeploy](/ottodeploy) includes an option to run a Post Deployment script after a file has been deployed to a server. This script can be used to do any setup that is required after the file has been deployed. You will need to specify the file to run the script on, the script name, and the login information for the file in question (since it may be a file not in your deployment). You can also specify the script parameters that will be passed to the script.
