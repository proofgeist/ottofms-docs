## Pause Scripts

The Pause Scripts button will open a window and pause all running scripts in OttoDeploy. Closing the window it opened will resume the scripts. This setting is intended to be used if you are trying to debug other FileMaker files while running OttoDeploy. Pausing the running scripts in OttoDeploy will avoid any conflicts with the scripts you are trying to debug.
