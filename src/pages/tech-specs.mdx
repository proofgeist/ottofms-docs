# Technical

## Operating system

OttoFms will run on any operating system that is certified to run FileMaker Server 19.6 or greater.

## FileMaker Server version

FileMaker Server version 19.6 or greater is required. OttoFMS will not work with FileMaker Server 19.5 or earlier.

## Claris support

FileMaker Server 19.6 and greater is currently supported by Claris. However on Feb, 28, 2024 Claris will end support for FileMaker Server 19. We will not do anything to prevent you from using OttoFMS with FileMaker Server 19.6 after that date, but we will prioritize support for the Claris supported versions of FileMaker Server.

You can check the current schedule for End of Life dates for FileMaker Server on the [Claris website](https://support.claris.com/s/answerview?anum=000034564&language=en_US).
