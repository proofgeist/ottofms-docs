# First Deployment

We recommend that you do a very simple deployment first to ensure everything is installed correctly. Start with a small simple example file. Install it on two of your servers. Setup and run a deployment using that simple file.

Take a look at the [simple deployment pattern](/guides/deployment-patterns/dev-to-prod) in the guides section. It will walk you through the process of creating a simple deployment between the two servers.
