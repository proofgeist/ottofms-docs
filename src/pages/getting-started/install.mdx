# Installing OttoFMS

<Callout>
  **Coming from Otto v3?** <br />
  <span>Read the [upgrade guide](/otto3) first!</span>
</Callout>

## Preflight Checklist

Before you begin, confirm the following:

- FileMaker Server is installed and running on your server
- You have Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for your server and a valid SSL certificate. The Claris default self signed cert is not sufficient for OttoFMS to work.
- Your server machine meets the [minimum requirements to run OttoFMS](/tech-specs)
- You have administrator rights to your server
- You can access the FileMaker Server Admin Console
- You have your free [OttoFMS license key](https://www.proofgeist.com/products/ottofms-filemaker-server-superpowers)
- You can access the OttoFMS license server at [https://edd-sl-proxy.geistgate.com](https://edd-sl-proxy.geistgate.com) using a web browser within your network. If you get a time-out error or you get a blank page, you may need to modify your firewall or network access rules to allow access.

<Callout type="warning">
  OttoFMS expects FileMaker Server to be running with the default `fmserver`
  user and `fmsadmin` group privileges. This is set during FileMaker Server
  installation. It is very rarely changed, but if you did change it, OttoFMS
  will not install correctly.

Select your operating system for specific installation instructions:

```

### Verify Full Disk Access

OttoFMS on Mac needs Full Disk access to work properly. This should be taken care of by the installation guide, but now is a great place to double-check!

Follow [this guide](/guides/mac-second-disk) to verify that OttoFMS has Full Disk Access. If you find that you had to manually enable it, be sure to [restart OttoFMS](/managing-ottofms/starting-stopping#macos) after turning it on for this to take effect.
