</Callout>

## Preflight Checklist

Before you begin, confirm the following:

- FileMaker Server is installed and running on your server
- Your server machine meets the [minimum requirements to run OttoFMS](/tech-specs)
- You have administrator rights to your server
- You can access the FileMaker Server Admin Console
- You have your free [OttoFMS license key](https://www.proofgeist.com/products/ottofms-filemaker-server-superpowers)
- You can access the [OttoFMS license server](https://edd-sl-proxy.geistgate.com) using a web browser within your server's network. If get time out error, or you get a blank page, you may need to modify your firewall or network access rules to allow access.

<Callout type="warning">
  OttoFMS expects FileMaker Server to be running with the default `fmserver`
  user and `fmsadmin` group privileges. This is set during FileMaker Server
  installation. It is very rarely changed, but if you did change it, OttoFMS
  will not install correctly.

Select your operating system for specific installation instructions:

### Option 1: Install using our install script

We have set up a hosted install script that you can run on your server to install OttoFMS. This script can also be used to update to a different version of OttoFMS later.

To run, simply copy and paste the following command into your terminal:

```cmd copy
sudo curl -sSL "https://appupdates.proofgeist.com/ottofms/install.sh" | bash
```

If you'd like to install a specific version of OttoFMS, you can specify the version number as a parameter:

```cmd copy
sudo curl -sSL "https://appupdates.proofgeist.com/ottofms/install.sh" | bash -s -- -v 4.0.1-beta.19
```

### Option 2: Manual Install

<Steps>
### SSH into your Linux Server

- [Download Linux Installer](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/latest/amd)
