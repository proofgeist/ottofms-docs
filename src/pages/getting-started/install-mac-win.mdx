# Installing OttoFMS (Mac/Windows)

Note: OttoFMS does work on Apple Silicon based Macs under Rosetta 2. Even though it isn't running natively it is still very fast. We are planning to have an Apple Silicon native version in the future.

## Pre-flight Checklist

Before you begin, confirm the following:

- FileMaker Server is installed on your server
- Your server machine meets the [minimum requirements to run OttoFMS](/tech-specs)
- You have administrator rights to your server
- You can access the FileMaker Server Admin Console
- If you are using macOS and you have second disk setup as the default backup, please read [this article](/guides/mac-second-disk) before installing OttoFMS.

<Callout type="warning">
	OttoFMS expects FileMaker Server to be running with the default `fmserver`
	user and `fmsadmin` group privileges. This is set during FileMaker Server
	installation. It is very rarely changed, but if you did change it, OttoFMS
	will not install correctly.

## Installation

<Steps>

### Download the OttoFMS Installer file

The download package you recieve is a zip file, Unzip it for the actual Installer

- If you are installing on a server on a different machine, we advise moving the zip folder to the server before unzipping to save bandwidth and avoid issues with how the installer is handled by the transfer

To access your file downloads, log in to your account and navigate to the [Purchase History tab](https://www.geistinteractive.com/account/?_gl=1*vbuibo*_ga*MjEyNjIwMjQxOC4xNjkzNDIzOTk0*_ga_XSEJBWFBW9*MTY5NDgxNzQ3MC4xMC4xLjE2OTQ4MTg1NTQuMC4wLjA.#tab-id-2).

### Navigate to the OttoFMS installer on your server and launch it

### Follow the steps in the installation wizard

### Open the OttoFMS Web Console

Open your browser and enter https://[host].com/otto/, where [host] is the fully qualified domain name of your FileMaker Server machine. This will open up the OttoFMS web console.

- (mac servers, only) - If you are using a second disk for backups, you will need to [configure OttoFMS to use it](/guides/mac-second-disk) before you can use the web console.
