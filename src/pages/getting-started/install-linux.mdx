# Installing OttoFMS (Linux)

## Pre-flight Checklist

Before you begin, confirm the following:

- FileMaker Server is installed on your server
- Your server machine meets the [minimum requirements to run OttoFMS](/tech-specs)
- Make sure your server has a a swap file configured for additional virtual memory.
- You have administrator rights to your server
- You can access the FileMaker Server Admin Console
- You can access the [OttoFMS license server](https://edd-sl-proxy.geistgate.com) using a web browser

<Callout type="warning">
	OttoFMS expects FileMaker Server to be running with the default `fmserver`
	user and `fmsadmin` group privileges. This is set during FileMaker Server
	installation. It is very rarely changed, but if you did change it, OttoFMS
	will not install correctly.
