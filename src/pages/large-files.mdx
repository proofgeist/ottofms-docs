# Handling very large files

<Callout type="warning">
  If you are trying to move very large FileMaker files, anything over 2 or 3
  gbs, using replace or install, we recommend that you run a
  [build](/concepts/builds) ahead of time and use the [Build
  URL](/concepts/public-builds) method to do deployment.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Deployments using `migrate` are not affected by this limitation.
</Callout>

## The problem

Transferring large files between FileMaker servers with OttoFMS is currently very slow. We are aware of this problem and are working on a solution. We hope to validate the new method in the next week or two.

This only effects deployments that are using install or replace as the file operation. The `migrate` file operation is not affected by this limitation.

## The solution for now

You can build ahead of time using the [build](/concepts/builds) process and a manual transfer to a webserver or other location. Then use the [Build URL](/concepts/public-builds) method to do deployment.
