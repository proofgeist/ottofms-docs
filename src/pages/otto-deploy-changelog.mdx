# OttoDeploy Version History

## 1.2.1

Released: 4/3/2024

### Patch Changes

- fixed icon sizes on windows being too large

## 1.2.0

Released: 3/18/2024

### Minor Changes

- builds can now be deleted from your OttoFMS outbox on your server directly from OttoDeploy. This option is available in the three dots menu on the build screen
- OttoDeploy now allows files within a deployment or sub-deployment to be duplicated. This will allow you to add the same file to a deployment multiple times with different destination filenames. You are unable to add the same file with the same destination filename multiple times. This option is available when using advanced options.
- Added the ability to run a single sub-deployment when using advanced options. This lets you choose a specific sub-deployment from your list to run rather than having to deselect all sub-deployments and select the one you want to run. This action can be performed using the new button in the top right of a sub-deployment
- builds that have been run on a server can now be downloaded from the three dot menu in the top right of the build screen. The build can only be downloaded if it is present on the server you have selected on the build screen.

### Patch Changes

- added the files column to the builds table
- added a description to builds and deployments so comments can be added
- there is now an option to delete a build from the OttoFMS outbox when you delete it from OttoDeploy. This allows you to do more discrete build management from ottoDeploy.
- password input fields will no longer autocorrect or autocomplete
- removed validation from schedule time in OttoDeploy. This will allow you to schedule deployments for servers in different timezones. The schedule time you enter is for the server timezone, not your current timezone. OttoFMS still does validation to ensure that the time you enter is in the future, but that validation is based on the server timezone.
- otto theme color and tag are now stored locally, preventing a short instant of no color or tag on load into OttoDeploy
- the sidebar will now remember whether it was opened or closed the last time you used OttoDeploy and will match that behavior
- turned off fuzzy matching on the deployment and builds table, only exact matching will be used for searching.
- fixed an issue where validation messages would be applied to the incorrect sub-deployment when only running some sub-deployments
- increased the size of the close button in the review deployment screen

## 1.1.1

Released: 3/1/2024

### Patch Changes

- allow clearing of "Hide Unselected" button when no deployments selected
- fixed an issue with the three dot menu on the deployments list opening the deployment rather than opening the menu

## 1.1.0

Released: 3/1/2024

### Minor Changes

- Redesign deployments list view. Filter by files, select deployments for custom filtering, and more.
- Add file selection and sub-deployment selection to easily skip files or sub-deployments while still saving them in your Deployment
- Builds and servers table updated and streamlined
- added concurrency as an advanced option for a sub-deployment. This setting will work on servers running OttoFMS version 4.2.0 or higher and controls how many files will be processed concurrently.
- Added build options for Just in time builds when using advanced settings. zip compression and memory levels can be adjusted.

### Patch Changes

- form fields with errors will now be cleared when you fix the error.
- fixed a bug where the destination encryption key would not be used.
- Add filename to destination field by default
- Auto-select "migrate" if the file is already on the destination
- added a flag on the build files table that shows whether or not that file will be cloned
- updated the flow of deployment creation to call out the default file options button.
- updated build flow to match deployment flow
- wrap long build URLs in deployment review modal
- Reduce frequency of build URL validation, avoiding a slow down when typing out build url
- validation of source files from a build will now occur against the files in the buid, not the files on the source server
- updated migration icon
- the default use advanced settings function will now work properly when creating a new deployment
- additional files to close dropdown is now searchable and has a max height, preventing it from extending past the edge of the screen if there are a lot of files on the destination.
- fixed a couple of bugs with the file operation validation
- the add/edit server modal will no longer close if you accidentally click outside of it while editing
- custom file paths can now be entered into the destination locale option. This functionality will not work unless the destination server has been updated to OttoFMS version 4.1.1 or later.
- the number of scripts running while creating a deployment or build has been reduced, meaning there will be fewer beeps that prevent you from interacting with the filemaker client
- updated configure default file options button to make it more intuitive

## 1.0.3

Released: 2/13/2024

### Patch Changes

- copy build json and copy deployment json modals will no longer jump around when toggling secrets on and off
- password field will now display the password instead of the username for migrations
- OttoDeploy now prevents attempting to deploy a file onto itself (on the same server). Previously, migrations from a file onto itself were failing without a good warning, and installs and replaces do nothing. Now these operations will be prevented on the OttoDeploy side.
- added better feedback for invalid file operations
- added a default date of 1 hour in the future for scheduling a deployment. this default is only in the UI, it can be changed from the scheduling modal.
- OttoDeploy can now display the FMS version when adding a new server even if it does not find ottoFMS on the server
- added server tag and colors to the builds and servers lists
- updated ui of the add/edit server modal to more closely match the input flow
