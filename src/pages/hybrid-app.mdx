# Hybrid app

OttoDeploy is a Hybrid app. It's user interface is built interely in HTML CSS and Javascript. The entire ui is in a single web viewer on a sngle layout. The data is stored in FileMaker Tables and Fields and the logic is expressed in both FileMaker Scripts and Javascript.

While not every use case calls for the extra work of building a bybrid, we belive it makes perfect sense for OttoDeploy

## Why?

### Modern UI

OttoDeploy is built to the highest modern interface standards, with suport for things like dark mode, accessibility, and responsive design. We can also choose from 100's of prebuilt components to make a highly deymanic application that we hope is a pleasure to use.

### Easier updates

Since a high perceentage of the application is text stored in single text field in a FileMaker table, many updates are just a matter of updating that single field with a new version of the code.

### Why not a cloud based web app?

We certainly could build all of OttoDeploy into a web app. We could just add it to [Ottomatic](https://www.ottomatic.cloud/), our hosting platform. But we have some users who can't connect to the public internet at all. They would be unable to use OttoDeploy if it was a cloud based web app.

Also we think some users might be hesitent about storing their deployment data in the cloud. Since OttoDeploy is a HybridFileMaker app, you can host it on your own server and keep all of your data as secure as the rest of your FileMaker systems.

## Trade offs

While the application is unocked and you control it, the UI and the logic will be very difficult if not impossible for you to customize the way you might be used to with other unlocked solutions.

But we believe that the trade off is worth it. You will get a better looking application that is easier to use and we will make sure that it is aways upgradable.

We will be inclucing ways for you to integrate with OttoDeploy so that you can build custom workflows without giving up OttoDeploy's modern UI and upogradablity.
