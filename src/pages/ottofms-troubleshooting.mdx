### I installed OttoFMS on a Mac and its not working

If you have installed OttoFMS on a Mac and it will not run and is not producing logs in the /OttoFMS/logs folder, you may need to give OttoFMS full disk access. See our [Mac Second Disk](/guides/mac-second-disk) guide for instructions on how to do this.
