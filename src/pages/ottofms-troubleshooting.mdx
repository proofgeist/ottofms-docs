# Troubleshooting OttoFMS

This page walks through some common errors in OttoFMS and how to fix them. If you don't see your problem on this list, check out our [support](/support) options.

## I installed OttoFMS on a Mac and it's not working

If you have installed OttoFMS on a Mac and it will not run and it is not producing logs in the /OttoFMS/logs folder, you may need to give OttoFMS full disk access. See our [Mac Second Disk](/guides/mac-second-disk) guide for instructions on how to do this.

## Deployments fail with the ENONT permission error on Mac

If you are using an external hardrive for your backups and you are getting the ENONT permission error on Mac, you may need to give OttoFMS full disk access. See our [Mac Second Disk](/guides/mac-second-disk) guide for instructions on how to do this.

Another solution is to set the external drive permissions to "ignore ownership". Select the drive in Finder, click on the "Get Info" button, and then click the lock icon in the bottom right corner. Check "Ignore Ownership on this volume" and click "Apply to enclosed items".

## Nothing is working and my server doesn't have a valid SSL certificate

OttoFMS requires a Valid SSL Certificate to communicate with other servers and itself. The Claris Self signed certificate is not valid. You have a few options to fix this:

1. Purchase a valid SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority and install it on your server.
2. Use a free SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). You can use the [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to install the certificate on your server.
3. Use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). This will create a secure tunnel to your server and provide a valid SSL certificate.
4. Ask us about Aperture, our secure tunneling service that is similar to ngrok but tuned for FileMaker Server. It will be available soon, through our hosting platform [Ottomatic](https://www.ottomatic.cloud)

## My Migrations are failing with a Signal Killed (SIGKILL) or Segmentation Fault error

This is likely caused by running out of memory. On many Operating Systems a process that uses up too much memory will be killed directly by the OS, causing a SIGKILL error for the process. If you are running a Linux server without a swap file or if your server does not have enough RAM or virtual memory this can happen. Check out our [recommended specifications](/tech-specs#production-servers) for OttoFMS servers for some base specifications.

A similar error can be caused by having corrupted FileMaker files when you try to run a migration. If you are getting Segmentation Fault errors, try to run recovery on your file and migrate it again.

## I ran a migration with OttoFMS and now FileMaker reports that my file is corrupted

OttoFMS uses the FileMaker Data Migration Tool to migrate files. OttoFMS does not have the ability to cause corruption in your file, but it is possible that the file may be in a corrupted state before migration. If you are getting errors when migrating a file try the following:

1. Run recovery on the source and destination files. This will tell you where the corruption is.
2. Handle the corruption. For help with this, please check our the [Claris Recovery docs](https://help.claris.com/en/pro-help/content/recovering.html) or reach out in the [Claris Community Forum](https://community.claris.com).
3. Ensure all Recovered Libraries in the files are removed before running the migration again.
4. Run the migration again.

## I installed or updated OttoFMS but I can't access the web console

If you've just installed or upgraded OttoFMS and you cannot access the web console, there may be an issue with the http server or an error on startup. You can try the following to resolve the issue:

<Steps>

### Restart the FileMaker HTTP Server

If you have an issue connecting to the web console, the FileMaker HTTP Server may not have properly restarted when OttoFMS was installed. You can try restarting the FileMaker HTTP Server to see if that resolves the issue.

```bash copy
fmsadmin restart httpserver
```

### Check if OttoFMS is running

<Tabs items={["Linux", "Windows", "MacOS"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    On Linux, you can check if OttoFMS is running by running the following command:

    ```bash copy
    sudo systemctl status ottofms-proofgeist-com.service
    ```

    If OttoFMS is not running, you can start it by running the following command:

    ```bash copy
    sudo systemctl start ottofms-proofgeist-com.service
    ```

    If this fails to start, there may be an issue with OttoFMS. Proceed to the next step to check the logs.

  <Tabs.Tab>
  On Windows, you can check the status of OttoFMS by going to Computer Management > Services and Applications > Services. Find the OttoFMS service and check if it is running.

If OttoFMS is not running, you can start it by right-clicking on the OttoFMS service and selecting "Start".

If this fails to start, there may be an issue with OttoFMS. Proceed to the next step to check the logs.

On MacOS, you can check the status of OttoFMS by running the following command:

```bash copy
sudo launchctl list | grep ottofms
```

If OttoFMS is not running, you can start it by running the following command:

```bash copy
sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.proofgeist.ottofms.plist
```

If this fails to start, there may be an issue with OttoFMS. Proceed to the next step to check the logs.

### Check the OttoFMS logs

If you are still unable to access the web console, there may be an error when OttoFMS starts. You can check the OttoFMS logs to see if there are any errors. The OttoFMS logs are located in the OttoFMS application folder.

In the otto-info.log you will be able to see if OttoFMS is starting up properly. A successful OttoFMS startup will look like this:

```
info	otto internal database up to date
info	Listening on http://localhost:3061
info	environment "production"
info	version "4.4.0"
info	node version v20.11.1
info	started watching offsite backup
info	started watching for hostname changes
info	Restarted httpserver
info	Reverse Proxy installed or updated
info	Ottomatic License status: valid
```

The log messages may vary slightly based on your system, OttoFMS version, and Operating System.

If your otto-info.log does not have any errors and it does not have the above start up messages, OttoFMS may have a problem starting up. proceed to the next step to take a look at system logs.

If you have an error in the otto-info.log file, review it and attempt to resolve the issue. If you are unfamiliar with the error, search or reach out in the [Community Forum](https://community.proofgeist.com) for help.

### Check the system logs

If OttoFMS is not starting up properly, the system logs may have more details about the issue.

# Common Errors

## TypeError: terminated or Signal Killed (SIGKILL) or Segmentation Fault

This error is caused by OttoFMS running out of memory and being terminated by the OS. This may happen if you run multiple processes in parallel, or if OttoFMS attempts to use too much memory. If you did not attempt to run mutiple OttoFMS actions simultaneously and this error is occuring, please reach out in the [Community Forum](https://community.proofgeist.com) for help.

You should also make sure your serer has enough memory and virtual memory to run OttoFMS. See our [recommended specifications](/tech-specs#production-servers) for OttoFMS servers for some base specifications.

## Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/backups/OttoFMS'

This error is caused by a permissions issue on the backup folder. OttoFMS uses the fmserver user to create the OttoFMS folder in the backups directory. To correct, ensure that your fmserver user has the necessary permissions to create the OttoFMS folder.

## DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated ...

This error is expected when you are running OttoFMS. It does not cause any problems, but we are working on a fix to remove this warning.
