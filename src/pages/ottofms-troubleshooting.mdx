# Troubleshooting OttoFMS

This page walks through some common errors in OttoFMS and how to fix them. If you don't see your problem on this list, check out our [support](/support) options.

## I installed OttoFMS on a Mac and its not working

If you have installed OttoFMS on a Mac and it will not run and is not producing logs in the /OttoFMS/logs folder, you may need to give OttoFMS full disk access. See our [Mac Second Disk](/guides/mac-second-disk) guide for instructions on how to do this.

## Nothings working and my server doesn't have a valid SSL certificate

OttoFMS requires a Valid SSL Certificate to communicate with other servers and itself. The Claris Self signed certificate is not valid. You have a few options to fix this:

1. Purchase a valid SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority and install it on your server.
2. Use a free SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). You can use the [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to install the certificate on your server.
3. Use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). This will create a secure tunnel to your server and provide a valid SSL certificate.
4. Ask us about Aperture, our secure tunneling service that is similar to ngrok but tuned for FileMaker Server. It will be available soon, through our hosting platform [Ottomatic](https://www.ottomatic.cloud)
