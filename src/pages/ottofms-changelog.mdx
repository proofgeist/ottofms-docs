## 4.6.0

Released: 8/7/2024

Download for [Linux](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.6.0/amd), [Linux (arm)](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.6.0/arm), [Windows](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.6.0/win), [Mac](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.6.0/mac)

### Minor Changes

- Offsite backups now support multiple offsite locations and offsite schedules. Multiple schedules can point at a single offsite location or different offsite locations. Existing offsite schedules and setups are converted to the new format automatically.
- Builds can now be deployed from offsite storage locations. With publishing functionality, this allows you to put builds up on s3 locations and pull them back down onto a different server.
- Existing backup schedules can now be used as offsite schedules. Simply select "Use Existing Schedule" when setting up an offsite schedule to send backups from that schedule offsite, no changes to the schedule needed!
- Builds can now be published to any of the server's offsite storage locations.
- Added a full suite of APIs to the developer API which can manage OttoFMS webhooks. Check out the API documentation for more information.
- Exposed new APIs in the Developer API that allow you to get and set OttoFMS settings like theme color, auto register webhooks, and the number of deployment backups to keep.
- The message sent when closing files during a deployment can now be customized.
- Added a new endpoint in the developer API to get details about an Admin API Key.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where the JIT_BUILD_TIMEOUT_IN_SEC env variable was not properly applied.
- Added a new env option DEBUG which will print extra logs to a new otto-debug.log file. This provides deeper insight into webhooks, builds, deployment, and server api calls. It can be a useful tool to provide for support questions and for troubleshooting.
- Added more details to the response from the data api key and admin api key endpoints in the developer API.
- Setting the "Max backups to keep" setting on an offsite backup schedule to 0 will now properly rename the backup folder to include the timestamp, send the timestamped folder to your offsite location, and delete the folder after the offsite is sent. This ensures that the offsite backups do not take up any space on your server after they have been sent to your offsite location.
- Added a "Run Now" button to the OttoFMS Offsite Backup Settings which will immediately run the selected offsite backup schedule and send the backups to your offsite.
- Usage data now includes a count of webhooks sent.
- Made the JIT build poller hardier to errors.
- Increased the default timeout time of pre-build and post-deployment scripts from 2 minutes to 1 hour. These values can be overriden using new env variables POST_DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT_IN_SEC and PRE_BUILD_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT_IN_SEC.
- Usage data now includes offsite backups. Data sent is the number of files, size of the files, and time elapsed.
- Fixed an error where using a Data API Key for the incorrect database would crash OttoFMS.

## 4.5.0

Released: 7/15/2024

Download for [Linux](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.5.0/amd), [Linux (arm)](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.5.0/arm), [Windows](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.5.0/win), [Mac](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.5.0/mac)

### Minor Changes

- Builds can now be published from the source server build outbox to a destination server build inbox or to the source server's HTTP folder. More options for build publish locations are planned, including web servers and offsite storage locations. This will be useful to set up public URLs to pull builds from, send builds for a deployment ahead of time so you can ensure that downtimes occur precisely when you expect them to, and more.
- Overhauled the OttoFMS File Manager with a whole new UI and backend. The new file manager has resumable uploads, faster handling, a refresh button, and more customizable settings.
- The FileMaker Database folders are now exposed in the OttoFMS File Manager under the "Live Databases" folder. These will not allow you to make any changes to live FileMaker files, but you will be able to see folder structure, manage external container data, and access the Removed_by_FM folders.
- Added the additional container data folders to the OttoFMS file manager. These are displayed within the "Live Databases" folder.
- Builds and deployments can now be chained off of each other. This allows for multi-stage deployments to different destination servers, as well as more complex build and deployment management. Support for this feature is coming to OttoDeploy soon.
- Deployments now have a "pushBuild" option in the API. This option will upload the build from the source instead of downloading the build to the destination. When using this option, transfers of large builds from Windows servers should be significantly faster as we avoid the IIS issues that cause slow downloads.
- OttoFMS now uses a login redirect to navigate you to your originally intended page after login. This means that if you follow a link to OttoFMS and are presented with the login page you can continue to the original page instead of being redirected to the dashboard page.
- The webhook receiver now accepts GET requests. By default this will include all query parameters in the body sent to the reciever script, and the includeHeaders query option is still respected.
- Converted the "Download both" button on the deployment page to download a full set of debug information. This zip will include the deployment log, the build log, the otto-info.log for 5 minutes before the deployment until 5 minutes after it end, the Event.log for that same time period, a combined log which has all four of these logs sorted by time, and a json file of server details.

### Patch Changes

- Made the admin api running from the OttoFMS server even hardier to issues
- If a migration errors, subsequent migrations will no longer attempt to run while the rest of the deployment continues.
- The settings you choose for the Databases table in the filemaker server tab will now be saved to your browser so your settings are kept across sessions.
- Added the option to download the build log for a deployment if available.
- Fixed an issue where the Additional Container Data Folder 2 would not be properly uploaded to offsite backups.
- Prevented a bug where webhooks without .fmp12 in the url would be saved separately from webhooks with .fmp12 in the url.
- The databases table on the filemaker server tab can now group files by status, client count, folder, sub folder, and privilege sets. This grouping will be saved off to your browser and carried across sessions.
- The cancel button in the ip filter settings modal on the OttoFMS console works now.
- Prevented blocking when restoring large backups.
- Removed the 32 character limit on the encryption modal confirm field.

## 4.4.0

Released: 6/20/2024

Download for [Linux](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.4.0/amd), [Linux (arm)](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.4.0/arm), [Windows](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.4.0/win), [Mac](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.4.0/mac)

### Minor Changes

- OttoFMS now supports recurring deployments. To set up a recurring deployment, schedule your deployment through OttoDeploy. Once it is scheduled, go to the FMS admin console and update the schedule (named OTTO\_\<deployment title>\_\<string of 5 random characters>) to whatever frequency you want the deployment to run. When the deployment finishes, a new deployment will be created and the schedule will be updated to run the new deployment the next time it runs.
- You can now set a custom environment tag and environment tag color.
- OttoFMS now allows for custom theme colors.
- Files can now be renamed via the api and from the databases list in the ottofms console. This rename is does not currently handle external file references or other plcaes where the filename is referenced.
- Expanded OttoFMS to support the File Browser and Log Viewer in the Ottomatic Cloud Console.
- Added the "ensureFilesOpen" option to the build API. This option will ensure that all files in the build are open after the build completes.

### Patch Changes

- Added database health checks on OttoFMS restart to prevent certain types of database corruption.
- Prevented an issue where the "sync custom hostname" setting would not stop syncing the custom hostname when turned off.
- Added a column for the next run time of scheduled deployments.
- The log select on the log viewer is now more responsive to long log names. we have also removed the ".log" from the end of the log names since they are all .log files.
- Fixed an issue where the status on the databases page would be vertically offset outside of the status badge when in a "loading" status (ie. when it was closing).
- The extended privelages column in the databases table will now allow filtering on multiple privelage sets and will allow selection of all privelage sets available in the files rather than a specific set.
- Fixed a typo causing "large_yellow_square" to appear in the aborted slack notification rather than a large yellow square.
- When aborting a deployment during a data migration, we will no longer migrate files after the one that was running when the deployment was aborted.
- There will no longer be a shortcut to the uninstaller stored right next to the uninstaller on Windows.
- When deleting a scheduled deployment, OttoFMS will now also delete the script schedule that will run said deployment.
- Added retries to the database fetching for the database page on the FileMaker admin tab in the OttoFMS console. This should harden the page to issues caused by 502 errors on Windows servers.
- The clients table will now account for the server timezone when displaying the time when a client logged in.
- Fix typo in the crashed slack notification.
- The data api proxy and webhooks now add the .fmp12 to the filename in the url if not present. It is no longer necessary to include the .fmp12 in the url when using the proxy or webhooks.
- OttoFMS no longer logs an error when redirecting to login since it is intended behavior.
- Starting, stopping, and restarting the FMS Database Server can now be performed via the API with an OttoFMS Admin API Key rather than requiring Basic Authentication. This means that the FMS Database Server can now be managed from the Ottomatic Cloud Console.

## 4.3.5

Released: 5/7/2024

Download for [Linux](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.5/amd), [Linux (arm)](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.5/arm), [Windows](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.5/win), [Mac](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.5/mac)

### Patch Changes

- fixes an issue with data api proxy that caused query parameters like \_limit and \_sort to fail

## 4.3.4

Released: 5/4/2024

### THIS IS A CRITICAL UPDATE CONTAINING SECURITY FIXES.

Download for [Linux](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.4/amd), [Linux (arm)](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.4/arm), [Windows](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.4/win), [Mac](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.3.4/mac)

### Patch Changes

- made offsite backup test errors more readable
- the offsite settings modal will no longer change when clicking outside it
- fixed an error adding an offsite backup location if there is no "/" at the end of the endpoint.
- fixed a security vulnerability in the OttoFMS console. This vulnerability is present in all versions prior to 4.3.4, we recommend that you update to this version as soon as possible.

## 4.3.3

Released: 4/29/2024

### Patch Changes

- the backup timeout time can now be overrided using the BACKUP_FILE_TIMEOUT_IN_SEC env variable. this defaults to 600 seconds (10 minutes).
- fixed links in the PLEASE-READ-FIRST.txt file
- The Just In Time build timeout can now be adjusted using the JIT_BUILD_TIMEOUT_IN_SEC env variable. This timeout is 30 minutes (1800 seconds) by default.
- moved the OttoFMSTempUploads folder from the fms Data directory into the OttoFMS folder inside of the FMS Backups folder. This should ensure that large files go onto a drive that has enough storage.
- the running deployment timer (and the values in the deployment log) will no longer roll back to 0 when the time surpasses 24 hours.
- copies can now be run on closed files in builds. copies run on closed files run much faster than copies on open files.
- encode special characters in fmp urls
- added the closeFiles option to the build input, allowing copies to be closed before running, speeding up the build dramatically.
- Webhooks used to upload files can now be registered in the OttoFMS console UI.
- Change icon for expanding sub-deployments in deployments table

## 4.3.2

Released: 4/22/2024

### Patch Changes

- files used in multiple sub-deployments will no longer be duplicated in the deployments table
- files closed during a deployment (using the close additional files option) will no longer be included in the files or file count in the deployments table.
- added the keepFilesClosedAfterComplete option to the deployment input, which prevents files from opening at the end of a sub-deployment.
- fixed an issue in the data api proxy causing the token refresh to fail.
- fixed an issue in which an unhandled rejection could occur in the file backup process during builds.

## 4.3.1

Released: 4/16/2024

### Patch Changes

- running a same server migration using a pre-run build on the same server will no longer fail with a "incoming file not found for install" error

## 4.3.0

Released: 4/12/2024

### Minor Changes

- Files can now be encrypted and decrypted from the FMS Admin databases tab. This feature is only available on servers running FMS 20.3 or later.
- File backups can now be restored directly from the OttoFMS file manager.
- OttoFMS now has the ability to only allow access to a list of IP addresses. This will only allow access to the OttoFMS api, console, and webhooks from the listed IP addresses or IP ranges. See the documentation for details on setting up a specific set of IPs or ranges of IPs.
- Added OttoFMS app log at /otto/api/app-log. See docs for instructions on setting up the OttoFMS app log to use logging in your FileMaker solutions or other systems.
- Added Slack notifications as an option to each sub-deployment. Notifications are sent when a sub-deployment starts, succeeds, fails, or crashes. See OttoFMS docs for details on setting up the slack integration.
- Added the closeFilesAfterBuild option to the deployment input, allowing depoyment files to be closed after the build fetches fully rather than before. This should cut down on the file downtime if the build process takes a while.
- Added the list deployments endpoint at /otto/api/deployments. This endpoint lists all deployments in the ottofms database. API Keys and passwords are encrypted in the response.
- Added the /deployment/rerun endpoint, which can rerun or schedule a rerun of a deployment or sub-deployment with the initially input options. Also added the ability to rerun a deployment or sub-deployment from the OttoFMS console. This is available in the three dot menu on the deployments table or in the deployment details view.
- Added a server preferences endpoint which returns the database folder preferences for the server. this endpoint is available at /otto/api/settings/serverPrefs.
- Added the ability to abort an ongoing deployment from the OttoFMS console and from the api. This function will only abort the deployment if no files have been replaced with their new versions. Builds that were downloaded will be removed, just in time builds will be deleted from your source server if applicable.
- A new api endpoint and options from the ui allow for undoing a deployment, including all of its sub-deployments. Previously only a single sub-deployment could be undone at a time.

### Patch Changes

- Builds now log to the build manifest.json as well as otto-info.log.
- The build manifest now includes individual file sizes. The file sizes get added upon the backups of the file being complete.
- A deployment failing before a build finishes downloading will now delete the build from the inbox.
- Added a startedAt key to the build manifest which stores the time the build was started
- The build log now displays in the deployment detail view on the build log tab.
- Build status calls for just in time builds are more hardy to 502 errors from windows source servers.
- Just in time builds will now be deleted before other builds when applying the "max builds to keep in outbox" setting.
- Builds that are ongoing during the time of an OttoFMS crash will now be marked as crashed.
- Partially downloaded builds will now be deleted when ottofms restarts.
- Just in time builds now have a "jit\_" prefix in the build id.
- Added the ability to send messages to clients from the clients table in the fms admin tab
- The clients table now has the ability to disconnect multiple clients at a time.
- Added an option to immediately disconnect clients from the clients table.
- Added an additional option when creating Data API keys via the OttoFMS API to not create duplicate keys. If the option is set to true, an existing data api key that uses the input credentials will be returned rather than creating a new key.
- File Launch links can not be copied from the databases table.
- A table with no deployments is now handled better in the deployments table.
- Usage data now includes durations and total size of built or deployed files.
- The Ottomatic backups folder in the file manager is now only created for Ottomatic servers.
- Added crashed deployment events to the usage data.
- Deployments and sub-deployments can now be renamed from the OttoFMS console after they have been run.
- If deployment is longer than 1 hour, the hours spot will always be displayed for each log message. This ensures that the first number you see is always the hours spot rather than suddenly becoming the hours spot at the hour mark.
- Files that are used in subsequent sub-deployments will not be opened at the end of a sub-deployment. For example, if you have 5 sub-deployments and a file is listed in your first and your last sub-deployment the file will be closed for the full duration of the deployment.
- Added the option to view the full detailed log for a running deployment.
- Users will now be redirected to the OttoFMS console if they are already logged in and go to the login page.
- The get deployment endpoint now returns more information about the deployment.
- Added the fms extended privelages column to the FMS admin databases table. This column is hidden by default and can be revealed in the top right of the table.
- Added folder and subfolder to databases table in the fms admin tab. These columns are hidden by default but can be revealed in the menus in the top right. Full file path can be revealed by hovering over the folder field in the table.
- The file manager no longer logs information about access to the otto-info.log. this can be reverted by setting the FILE_MANAGER_LOGGING environment variable to true.

## 4.2.4

Released: 3/19/2024

- Added files column to the deployments table

## 4.2.3

Released: 3/13/2024

### Patch Changes

- deployment backups now create folders and delete folders based off of full deployments instead of sub-deployments. This change means that your "deployment backups to keep" setting will now reflect the number of full deployments rather than sub-deployments. This change is not compatible with previous deployment backups, so make sure any deployment reverts or other processes you need to do with your backups through OttoFMS are done before upgrading to this version
- when in a deployment detail screen, the page title will now be the title of the deployment rather than the id.
- updated log message for file unzipped to say that the file is unzipping, as the log gets written at the start of the file unzipping

- errors in the deployment log now have a filename where applicable
- fixed issue with searching and filtering in the logs on the web console
- Attempt to avoid ECONNRESET error on windows when building
- undoing a deployment will now only revert changes for files that have backups. installs will be ignored. previously attempting to undo an install would result in a failed deployment.
- ottofms will now more gracefully handle errors caused by the FileMaker admin server restarting in the middle of a process.
- removed duplicate logs for number of completed files
- fixed an issue causing the entire file path to be written in the migration log on windows. now it will just write the filename
- fix issue with offsite backups on AWS regions other thatn us-east-1

## 4.2.2

Released: 3/5/2024

### Patch Changes

- Fix register webhooks regression
- Fixed an issue with Linux servers not being able to download builds over 1 GB. The download process should now be much faster on Linux machines.
- fixed an error in the admin api key api which would not allow an admin api key to be used immediately following its creation via the api.

## 4.2.1

Released: 3/1/2024

### Patch Changes

- fixed file not found error when running a deployment with the same source and destination server. Files in a local just in time build will no longer be zipped into an archive, they will just be moved from the outbox to the inbox as unzipped files.
- added log message that just in time build has started on source server.
- increased just in time build timeout from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
- added a log message when a deployment crashes
- fixed a bug in the duration cell for multi-stage deployments. The duration was not displaying or calculating correctly.

## 4.2.0

Released: 2/29/2024

### Minor Changes

- the create build api now has a memLevel option which can help manage the memory usage of the zipping process. by default it is set to 1, which is the least memory usage. See OttoFMS api docs for allowed values.
- completedFiles key added to the build manifest stored in the outbox. this value will be incremented with each file fully zipped during the build so we can track progress better.
- zipSize key added to the build manifest. This value will be set upon build completion with the size of the .build.zip in bytes.
- added concurrency to the OttoFMS api as a sub-deployment level setting. The concurrency setting manages how many files will be installed or migrated simultaneously.

### Patch Changes

- uninstalling OttoFMS on windows will now fully remove all IIS routing rules put in place by the installer
- improved logging for delete build and get build status endpoints
- we are now making even fewer calls to the admin api where possible
- added link to the webhooks guide from the error if your database is not properly set up to recieve webhooks
- timers for running deployment will now update based on deployment start time rather than most recent log message, making them more accurate in the ui.
- Builds will now delete each file from the outbox folder after they are successfully zipped into the .build.zip file. This should dramatically reduce folder size in the outbox.
- OttoFMS now only logs that remaining deployments will be aborted (when using the abort remaining option) if there are remaining deployments to abort
- added an ongoing duration to the running deployment screen
- added better error handling within the build status endpoint
- updated the formatting of deployment times in the deployment table, deployment details view, and the dashboard
- added more logs to the zip creation process
- the manifest.json inside of the .build.zip file will now have a status of "zipping" instead of "started". This value is not updated to "completed" since we update the manifest to "completed" after the zip is complete.
- we now only log that we are removing builds from the inbox at the end of a deployment if there are builds to remove
- changed the default compression level of build zips from -1 to 0 (this will apply very little compression to the zips by default, increasing file size and decreasing zip time). This should increase fetch time and decrease zip time. The compression level can be changed in the api, and it will be added to OttoDeployin the future.
- Fixed an issue that caused OttoFMS to check the wrong disk for available space before starting deployments
- zips created by ottofms will no longer have errors when unzipped with services like 7zip
- fixed issue where the copied webhook url would include the masked api key rather than the full api key.
- added more logging to the fetching phase of deployments so you can see progress as the deployment runs.
- added server operating system to collected usage data. This will help us target specific operating systems which are having more trouble running processes on OttoFMS
- Add error handling and logging for file download

## 4.1.1

Released: 2/21/2024

### Patch Changes

- fix error causing target locale not to be carried through properly to the data migration tool
- resuming a deployment will now run a local build rather than fetching if it makes sense to do so.
- a failure to keep the admin api token alive while running a dpeloyment will now log an error
- a running deployment will now make fewer calls to the admin api
- fixed an issue that allowed Otto3 license to be recognized as valid.

## 4.1.0

Released: 2/12/2024

### Minor Changes

- deployments running between the same source and destination server using a just in time build will now delete the just in time build from the outbox locally rather than making a http request to do it
- clients can now be disconnected from the client table on the filemaker server tab
- if doing a deployment with the same source and destination server, the build will be run locally rather than creating a http request to run the build
- deployments running with the same source and destination server will now copy builds from the outbox to the inbox rather than make a http request for them

### Patch Changes

- migrations longer than 15 minutes will no longer crash with an invalid token error
- allow login to ottoFMS console after changing the FMS password
- better errors for the fetch failed errors
- we no longer log that the files were opened successfully at the end of a deployment if there were no files opened successfully
- admin api keys now have a last used time rather than an updated time. It will display the last time that admin api key was used in the OttoFMS api or the Admin API proxy
- use locale formatting for deployment start date and time in table and specific deployment page
- upload fm file modal no longer shows a red X when try to upload any file. It will now show an upload icon for all files, and an error will show if the file is not a .fmp12 file.
