### Patch Changes

- deployment backups now create folders and delete folders based off of full deployments instead of sub-deployments. This change means that your "deployment backups to keep" setting will now reflect the number of full deployments rather than sub-deployments. This change is not compatible with previous deployment backups, so make sure any deployment reverts or other processes you need to do with your backups through OttoFMS are done before upgrading to this version
- when in a deployment detail screen, the page title will now be the title of the deployment rather than the id.
- updated log message for file unzipped to say that the file is unzipping, as the log gets written at the start of the file unzipping
- the deployment logs csv now has formatted durations
- Fixed an issue with FileManager uploads on ubuntu
- ottofms will no longer fail to start if there are extra folders in the File Manager root directory.
- the deployment log csv now has the file column properly populated
- hardening OttoFMS against an issue with the FileMaker Server Admin API
- errors in the deployment log now have a filename where applicable
- fixed issue with searching and filtering in the logs on the web console
- Attempt to avoid ECONNRESET error on windows when building
- undoing a deployment will now only revert changes for files that have backups. installs will be ignored. previously attempting to undo an install would result in a failed deployment.
- ottofms will now more gracefully handle errors caused by the FileMaker admin server restarting in the middle of a process.
- removed duplicate logs for number of completed files
- fixed an issue causing the entire file path to be written in the migration log on windows. now it will just write the filename
- fix issue with offsite backups on AWS regions other thatn us-east-1

Released: 3/5/2024

### Patch Changes

- Fix register webhooks regression
- Fixed an issue with Linux servers not being able to download builds over 1 GB. The download process should now be much faster on Linux machines.
- fixed an error in the admin api key api which would not allow an admin api key to be used immediately following its creation via the api.

## 4.2.1

Released: 3/1/2024

Download for [Linux](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.1/amd), [Linux (arm)](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.1/arm), [Windows](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.1/win), [Mac](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.1/mac)

### Patch Changes

- fixed file not found error when running a deployment with the same source and destination server. Files in a local just in time build will no longer be zipped into an archive, they will just be moved from the outbox to the inbox as unzipped files.
- added log message that just in time build has started on source server.
- increased just in time build timeout from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
- added a log message when a deployment crashes
- fixed a bug in the duration cell for multi-stage deployments. The duration was not displaying or calculating correctly.

## 4.2.0

Released: 2/29/2024

Download for [Linux](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.0/amd), [Linux (arm)](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.0/arm), [Windows](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.0/win), [Mac](https://console.ottomatic.cloud/downloads/ottofms/4.2.0/mac)

### Minor Changes

- the create build api now has a memLevel option which can help manage the memory usage of the zipping process. by default it is set to 1, which is the least memory usage. See OttoFMS api docs for allowed values.
- completedFiles key added to the build manifest stored in the outbox. this value will be incremented with each file fully zipped during the build so we can track progress better.
- zipSize key added to the build manifest. This value will be set upon build completion with the size of the .build.zip in bytes.
- added concurrency to the OttoFMS api as a sub-deployment level setting. The concurrency setting manages how many files will be installed or migrated simultaneously.

### Patch Changes

- uninstalling OttoFMS on windows will now fully remove all IIS routing rules put in place by the installer
- improved logging for delete build and get build status endpoints
- we are now making even fewer calls to the admin api where possible
- added link to the webhooks guide from the error if your database is not properly set up to recieve webhooks
- timers for running deployment will now update based on deployment start time rather than most recent log message, making them more accurate in the ui.
- Builds will now delete each file from the outbox folder after they are successfully zipped into the .build.zip file. This should dramatically reduce folder size in the outbox.
- OttoFMS now only logs that remaining deployments will be aborted (when using the abort remaining option) if there are remaining deployments to abort
- added an ongoing duration to the running deployment screen
- added better error handling within the build status endpoint
- updated the formatting of deployment times in the deployment table, deployment details view, and the dashboard
- added more logs to the zip creation process
- the manifest.json inside of the .build.zip file will now have a status of "zipping" instead of "started". This value is not updated to "completed" since we update the manifest to "completed" after the zip is complete.
- we now only log that we are removing builds from the inbox at the end of a deployment if there are builds to remove
- changed the default compression level of build zips from -1 to 0 (this will apply very little compression to the zips by default, increasing file size and decreasing zip time). This should increase fetch time and decrease zip time. The compression level can be changed in the api, and it will be added to OttoDeployin the future.
- Fixed an issue that caused OttoFMS to check the wrong disk for available space before starting deployments
- zips created by ottofms will no longer have errors when unzipped with services like 7zip
- fixed issue where the copied webhook url would include the masked api key rather than the full api key.
- added more logging to the fetching phase of deployments so you can see progress as the deployment runs.
- added server operating system to collected usage data. This will help us target specific operating systems which are having more trouble running processes on OttoFMS
- Add error handling and logging for file download

## 4.1.1

Released: 2/21/2024

### Patch Changes

- increased single file backup timeout from 2 minutes to 10 minutes
- fixed bug in upload ui causing sub-folders for folders that were not the default to not display. Also prevented selecting a sub-folder in the secure folder via the ui, which matches current behavior.
- fix error causing target locale not to be carried through properly to the data migration tool
- resuming a deployment will now run a local build rather than fetching if it makes sense to do so.
- a failure to keep the admin api token alive while running a dpeloyment will now log an error
- a running deployment will now make fewer calls to the admin api
- fixed an issue that allowed Otto3 license to be recognized as valid.

### Minor Changes

- deployments running between the same source and destination server using a just in time build will now delete the just in time build from the outbox locally rather than making a http request to do it
- clients can now be disconnected from the client table on the filemaker server tab
- if doing a deployment with the same source and destination server, the build will be run locally rather than creating a http request to run the build
- deployments running with the same source and destination server will now copy builds from the outbox to the inbox rather than make a http request for them

### Patch Changes

- scheduled deployments that fail to properly create a schedule will now delete the created deployment and the created schedule to clean up after themselves.

- migrations longer than 15 minutes will no longer crash with an invalid token error

- we no longer log that the files were opened successfully at the end of a deployment if there were no files opened successfully

- use locale formatting for deployment start date and time in table and specific deployment page
- upload fm file modal no longer shows a red X when try to upload any file. It will now show an upload icon for all files, and an error will show if the file is not a .fmp12 file.
