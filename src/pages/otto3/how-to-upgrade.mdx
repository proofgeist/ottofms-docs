# Upgrading from Otto 3 to OttoFMS

There isn't an automated upgrade of your previous configurations or any of your data to OttoFMS. We recommend uninstalling Otto v3 before installing OttoFMS, but you can also install OttoFMS on top of Otto v3. See the [Should I Upgrade Yet](/otto3/should-i-upgrade-yet) guide for more information on having Otto v3 and OttoFMS running side by side.

## Upgrade Steps

1. Here is how to [uninstall](https://v3.ottofms.com/docs/otto/working-with-otto/uninstalling-otto) Otto v3 (recommended).
1. Here is how to [install](/managing-ottofms/installing-uninstalling) OttoFMS.

## Archive your old Otto 3 application directory

We recommend you keep the Otto 3 Directory after you uninstall Otto 3, just in case you need any of the data in there later. We can help you recover it if it becomes necessary.
