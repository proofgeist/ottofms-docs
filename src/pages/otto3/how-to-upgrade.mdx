# Upgrading from Otto 3 to OttoFMS

There isn't an automated upgrade of your previous configurations or any of your data to OttoFMS. We may have some tools in the future to migrate some of your settings, but for now, you'll need to do this manually. So upgrading is simply uninstalling Otto 3 and installing OttoFMS.

## Upgrade Steps

1. Here is how to [uninstall](https://v3.ottofms.com/docs/otto/working-with-otto/uninstalling-otto) Otto v3
1. Here is how to [install](/managing-ottofms/installing-uninstalling) OttoFMS

## Archive your old Otto 3 application directory

We recommend you keep the Otto 3 Directory after you uninstall Otto 3, just incase you need any of the data in there later. We can help you recover it if it becomes necessary.
