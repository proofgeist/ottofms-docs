# Logging into the OttoFMS Web Console

## Where is the OttoFMS web console?

The OttoFMS web console is the main interface for managing your OttoFMS server. It is available at https://[host].com/otto/, where [host] is the fully qualified domain name of your FileMaker Server machine. Don't forget the `/otto/` at the end of the URL.

## Logging in

To log in to the OttoFMS web console, you will need to enter your username and password. The username is the same as the username you use to log into the FileMaker Server Admin Console. The password is the same as the password you use to log into the FileMaker Server Admin Console.

## Logging out

You can log out of the OttoFMS web console by clicking the "Logout" button in the lower left corner of the web console.
